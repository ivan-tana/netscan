# python network devices scanner

use to scan the devices on the network and provide their ip address

first get the base ip of the network eg 192.168.8. 

then loop for the 255 posible ip address on the network and the network scanner runs a shell ping script to an ip address on the network and if it get a replay it means a device is avaialable on that ip
